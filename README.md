# Hello ðŸ‘‹
Here is my program of self vote.
I use a proxy to vote as many times as asking in a site which block IP adress.

## Proxy used :
- scraperAPI for post_vote
- selenium for selenium_vote

## Launch âš™
- For selenium_vote : 
     -  Installr selenium module with ```pip install selenium``` 
     -  Check if you have Google Chrome in 96 version install or replace chromedriver.exe by the good one of your chrome version [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org)
- For post_vote :
     -  Replace the APIkey in the "payload" with yours with scraperAPI 
     -  Install requests module with ```pip install requests``` then launch the program.

## Help/contact ðŸ“©
If you don't understand how it works or you come across a bug, contact me with my social media on my profile.
